Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. 
In this project, that is exactly what I am going to be doing as well. Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions 
and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, I'm going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. 
In this project, we will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest Algorithm

Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, I'll investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms 
can be misleading. In addition, we will explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, 
to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in our data set. 

Steps Followed are:--

Implemented Local Outlier Factor (LOF),Isolation Forest Algorithm to detect anomalies in 28,500 credit card transactions 
Achieved accuracy of 97% using Isolation Forest Algorithm with precision of 30% w.r.t to original dataset, i.e 30% of total fraud transactions
were detected
Predicted anamolies using Local Outlier Factor (LOF) had accuracy of 96% with precision of 10% which needs improvement
